"It was physics that convinced me that engineering was my natural calling. However, it did not feel very natural when I had to convince my family to let me move over a thousand kilometers away to a dormitory at the finest engineering university of the country. When you are a young girl in [Middle East] without a father, each one of your relatives, has the right to steer your life in the direction they think is suitable. Thus, often sooner rather than later, you learn how to find your voice and stand your ground."

"I graduated on the dean’s list as the only engineer in my entire extended family and entered the dynamic world of heat exchangers and cooling towers. My first job was to lead a poly vinyl chloride plant, as the youngest and, the only female engineer on the team. Six months in, I couldn’t wait to quit! Not because my love for turbines had subsided but because I was trapped in a small isolated room in an otherwise elaborate office. When I expressed my desire to be seated next to my male counterparts, my boss insisted that I would be more “comfortable” inside the room. At first, I considered it to be a genuine concern but later when he started addressing me in the third person instead of calling me by my name, I realized that it was much deeper than that. As a woman I made him uncomfortable. During lunch hours, my team would sit at a table across mine, discussing design calculations and critical management decision. I wasn’t even included in the most basic of discussions. How then was I supposed to leave a mark on the world?"
"I was encouraged by well-intentioned seniors to leave the field for a support function, but my heart was not ready to let go of engineering. Thus I looked for more avenues and when [American industrial service company] selected me for a role as a field engineer, I prepared myself for yet another exhilarating journey."
"I moved away from home for the second time and entered the oil field as the only Middle Eastern country female engineer to have ever worked in well completions division. I was hired in an international program which meant multiple trips to [American industrial service company]’s global education centers and soon found myself surrounded with colleagues who did not see me as a lesser being. Instead, they loved me for driving discussion, consulted me for difficult calculations and valued my opinion in critical decisions. I felt as if the world had opened its doors to me! Luckily this spirit of comradery and friendship followed me to the [Middle East] and stayed constant in my colleagues back home, as they witnessed me wreck numerous tools in the workshop while learning how to use pipe ranches, chain tongs, hammers, and drill machines."
"Eventually, I became proficient and started directing crews comprised entirely of men to lead the completion phase of oil and gas wells on drilling rigs in [Middle East]. As I used engineering to successfully extract fuel that was lighting streets, heating homes and energizing communities, I knew I had found my purpose. Knowing the impact energy has on the progress of a country, I understood that I wanted to use my expertise to make energy more accessible to all areas of [the Middle East]. I further understood that I wanted to diversify my experience in all aspects of the energy sector and later leverage that experience into starting my own energy consulting firm which would segregate areas within [the Middle East] on the basis of demographics, spawn customized solutions for those markets and then connect funding organizations to energy providers that can best meet those solutions. Being a part of something bigger, made me realize that contrary to myPrevious skepticism, I, in fact, could make a change in this world."
"Knowing the self-doubt I experienced earlier in my career, I did not want the younger generations of [Middle East Country] engineers to witness the same. In a country where women make up 48% of the population but only 18% of STEM professionals, we cannot afford to let most to lose their passion without recognizing their purpose. Thus along with three college friends of mine, I founded an organization called [Name of Nonprofit], which aims at providing an international network of professionals to young female engineers. I had seen the difference a strong network made in my life. It wasn’t that segregation of women was less pronounced on drilling rigs, but it was the support networks that provided me with the tools I needed to succeed in a challenging environment. Till now we have been able to enroll over twenty engineers in our organization and have organized multiple meet ups with experienced professionals, including one by the country director of [Middle East Company], culminating in an internship offer for one of our members."
"I had applied to Harvard in the third Round last year and had almost lost hope, till I visited Boston to take a class at HBS. I was overwhelmed by many of its aspects, but what struck me the most was the palpable passion and intense drive that every student and faculty member exhibited. It was so real that I could almost touch it. Witnessing the extremely diverse and energetic student body and exchanging with them views and ideas, I felt that there was nothing out of reach for them. They had unparalleled access to brilliant minds from across the globe and every idea they had could be tried and tested through the many avenues that HBS offered such as Harvard i-lab or the field global immersion program. The visit revived my dream to be a part of the HBS community and compelled me to give myself another shot as I feel that this is the only place where I could truly prepare to convert my dreams into reality."
"Reading about Tim Cook and Mary Barra, two business leaders I personally admire, I’ve often struggled to imagine them as twenty-something Associate’s - still wet behind the gills. Yet, like everyone else, that’s exactly where they began their careers. At twenty-seven, I sometimes think that my long-term goal, to become the CEO of a global manufacturing organization like [Name of big tech company], seems like a lofty one, but in those moments I remind (and reassure) myself that good business leaders aren’t born, but rather developed. For me, that development process is a three-fold one and involves cultivating knowledge, experience and good judgment.  I’ve grown in practical experience through steady career progression at [Name of big tech company] and progressive responsibility for larger projects, teams and deliverables. I’ve sought out and gleaned knowledge through the mentorship of seasoned professionals like [Name of individual], a President at [Name of big tech company], who has generously shared lessons and insights from his own career. The HBS case method appeals to me as a new way to experiment with business problems and hone good judgment because it represents a unique learning platform that exists between first-hand experience and imparted knowledge. In addition, the possibility to grow personally and contribute to the growth of others at HBS is made possible by the nature of the HBS student body, with its wealth of different industry and functional perspectives."
"While my professional experience has been critical, my personal experiences have been equally influential in shaping my vision of what good leadership and management mean. After immigrating to the US from [Name of Asian country], my father spent the remainder of his working life as a short-order cook, while my mother became a seamstress. Our family budget was always tight, but the situation was exacerbated when my father’s employer went bankrupt, and my father was laid off after twelve years of service. “[Name], truth is I fifty-two years old, can’t read and English not so good.” He never found work again. Directly assisting the General Managers of [Name of big tech company] Interiors Division, I’ve gained initial exposure to P&L management. That’s led me to wonder whether the bankruptcy might have been avoided through better leadership, managerial foresight or administration. Businesses are at the heart of any free-market economy, but they’re likewise an integral part of the social fabric. While they benefit shareholders and clients, they also exist as institutions from which individuals and their families derive a livelihood. That’s been top of mind for me when on location in [Name of Asian city], and, most recently, [Name of American city] where I’ve worked under pressure to turn around plants struggling to meet their business objectives."
"“The cleats are $50 and the uniform is another $90,” Mom told Dad in [Asian language]. “And the next thing you know, he’ll break his arm, and that’s $400 at the emergency room.”"
"What my sister and I went without weren’t so much the petty indulgences, like soccer, as the tacit and explicit guidance parents usually provide: helping their children navigate societal norms and envisage an educational path and professional career beyond high school. Anecdotally, as a high school senior, I naively submitted just one college application; singling out [Name of American University] largely because there was no application fee. "
"Because of my family situation, I believe that determination and self-reliance were qualities that I developed at an early age. At the time, they were coping mechanisms, but, today, I see them as characteristic of my approach to challenges. At [Name of big tech company], I’ve often found myself in uncharted territory, be that culturally, on-location at plants in [Name of Asian Country 1 & 2], or be that functionally, performing financial and operational valuations on acquisition targets. Over time I’ve come to know myself better and have developed a strong inner sense of what I can achieve. I think that type of self-knowledge is pivotal to leading others as well. In order to fully understand the challenges team members face in their work, managers and leaders at operationally focused organizations like [Name of big tech company] must be adept at building relationships on an interpersonal level and communicating on a technical one."
"“Any questions?” I asked, wrapping up my first meeting with staff – all of whom were [Name of Asian Country]. “Yes, when you leave?” asked [Name] in a tone that made me question whether the meeting had really gone as well as I thought."
"One example of relationship building took place when I was in my 3rd rotation of [Name of big tech company] Operations Leadership Program in [Name of Asian city]. Under the plant’sPrevious owner, [Name], managers weren’t expected to scrutinize metrics unless there was a blatant issue. Many people felt frustrated with the new [Name of big tech company] approach, which required them to record and analyze everything. My goal was to help the [Name of city] staff make the transition by taking reporting off their plates and handling it myself. [Name of Asian Country] is a very hierarchical society, and gossip and suspicion were rife in the plant. “You are taking over reporting for firing us.” I was emphatic, “No. We’re increasing production not reducing it. I’m trying to help you and the whole plant.”"
"My stance of ‘just wanting to help’ was seen as mere lip service because it deviated from the [Name of Asian Country] way of thinking. If my behavior was more culturally relatable to the staff, I thought I’d be more successful in sharing my ideas with them. "
"When I began touching my heart after every conversation as a sign of respect, people’s eyes would brighten in recognition. I began greeting colleagues in [Name of Asian Country], wore a traditional shirt on Fridays and, admittedly, resorted to a ‘ploy’ – showing up to an all hands meeting with banana fritters. Relations improved, and staff began sharing the data I’d been requesting. The same employees, who were at first reticent, ultimately played a huge role in carrying out our expansion plans and helping with logistics."
"Months later, we were on the cusp of expanding our manufacturing by fifty percent. I’d also managed to put staff at ease with capturing reporting data and discussing it with colleagues in the U.S. Reaching those milestones had to do with many smaller successes along the way. Chief among them was an ability to face communication and leadership challenges and work through them."
"Before heading back to the State’s, [Name] asked me again, “Hey, when you leave?” but this time it was in order to plan a going away tea for me at the plant. That felt great!"
"In this essay, I hope to have provided you with insight into where I’ve come from, where I’d like to go and my personal understanding of leadership. In closing, I’d like to thank you for your time in reviewing my application for the HBS Class of 2019."
"Have you heard of Leon C. Megginson? He emphasised a particular aspect of Charles Darwin’s traditional ‘survival of the fittest’ theory: one does not need to be the fittest, but merely be the most adaptable. Therefore the species that can best adjust to its changing environment will survive and thrive. This concept of adaptability has shaped the way I have approached change and challenge in my life, and will continue to support me in becoming a leader in healthcare in the future."
"With a [Latin America] mother, a [European] father, and a French passport, adaptability has been a part of my identity since my early childhood. The three languages I speak have allowed me to communicate with people across the world, and the cultures I have been exposed to have broadened my perspective. My upbringing has provided me with invaluable tools to live in the increasingly globalised world, and has enabled me to work across France, the UK, Spain, and the U.S."
"From an early age, I demonstrated adaptability by recognising and using my core strengths. Although I started dancing ballet at the age of three, I have always suffered from poor flexibility due to a hereditary hip condition. I have never been the dancer with her leg lifted the highest, which could have impacted my score in the annual examinations. However, I realised early on that ballet was as much an art form as it was a physical exercise and that, if I focused on the emotional story I was telling the judges, I could make them concentrate more on my face and arms, and less on my legs. This led me to consistently receive the highest score in the class, year upon year, surpassing all of the best technical dancers. "
"I also learnt the importance of adaptability through my experience of two different education systems, moving from a high school in France to study Human Sciences at [Prestigious University]. The French system has a disciplined style of teaching, with several hours of homework every evening and eleven different courses as part of the high-school degree. I was successful in this demanding system, getting the highest mark in my school in final examinations. The British system was demanding in a different way: whilst in France rote learning is favoured, in the British system students are expected to think for themselves. I had never been in a situation in which I was given a topic to deconstruct and debate with my peers, and had to learn fast how to adapt my way of thinking and to challenge other students’ perspectives. "
"As a life sciences and healthcare strategy consultant at [Consulting Firm], my work required me to constantly adapt to the organisations I worked with and the challenges that they faced. This adaptability was exemplified when I was selected to take part in a six-month placement to the [West Coast Office] office in 2013. On my first case there I flew to [Big City] for a two-day meeting with the management of a [Health Plan] company, to identify any issues that could hinder a due diligence process. I had no experience of this type of project or the U.S. healthcare system, but preparing extensively for the meeting allowed me to inform my questions and drive a fruitful discussion."
"Despite the important role that adaptation has played in my personal and professional life, I have learnt that it can also be destructive, for example when cells in our bodies adapt and attack their habitats. Some cells can outsmart the immune system our body has developed over thousands of years and, as a result, can grow, proliferate, and spread. It is our body’s innate adaptability that can cause cancer, and ultimately lead to its death. I know this all too well, cancer having struck my grandparents and my cousin."
"The immense challenge that cancer poses combined with the impact that it has had on my family made me want to apply my skills and energy to help fight it. I decided to switch from a career in consulting to work in the strategy team at [Cancer Research Firm]. Each year [the Cancer Research Firm] raises ~$845M from British individuals and corporations in order to fund and train more than 4,000 of the country’s foremost scientists, physicians, and nurses. The goal is to outsmart the human body; science is trying to adapt faster than the speed at which cancer evolves."
"In order to succeed, the scientific strategies that my team develops cannot afford to be reactive. The projects I lead are proactive, bold, and at the forefront of biomedical research. For example, I am currently defining how [the Cancer Research Firm] could become the largest non-governmental funder of cancer research in the world. This would put [the Cancer Research Firm] in a unique position to make progress in areas such as the early detection of cancer, and to get closer to its goal of beating cancer sooner. In my current role, I can ensure [the Cancer Research Firm] continuously challenges itself in order to tackle cancer faster and more effectively, however in the future I would like my impact to be even broader. "
"My long-term professional ambition is to be an agent of change in the healthcare industry by leading a disruptive organisation that will raise the quality of healthcare for patients. Reaching this goal will require leveraging my knowledge of healthcare as well as my strategic and analytical skills. However, being adaptable also means recognising when one needs to improve oneself in order to be successful, and being brave enough to take the next step. My background has so far been science-focused and, in order to achieve my professional goals, I would require the general management training, the opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship, and the focus on leadership that a Harvard MBA would provide. I am particularly interested in the opportunities offered by the Health Care Initiative, as I know through my own experience in cancer research how powerful collaboration and innovation can be in shaping new ideas and tackling big barriers to progress. I also hope that my European and not-for-profit experience would help provide my classmates with a different perspective and challenge their thinking."
"After obtaining my MBA, I would like to join a start-up in the healthcare sector and challenge myself to adapt to a dynamic and agile work environment. I have attentively followed the progress of Flatiron Health, a U.S.based start-up that analyses large amounts of cancer data to better understand and tailor treatments, which could forever change the way that cancer patients are treated. Recently I was fortunate to hear Dr. Amy Abernethy, Flatiron Health’s Chief Medical Officer, speak at a conference and I was inspired by her vision to build an adaptable healthcare system that is constantly learning from and adjusting to incoming data. My aim is that one day I, too, will be stood up in front of thousands of passionate and brilliant minds and present the next development in the evolution of healthcare. "
"When I originally became a mentor, I thought I understood the impact I could have on someone else’s life but did not believe that someone half my age would have much to teach me.  Freshman year at [Private College], I signed up to be a Community Friend and was soon introduced to a nine-year-old named [Female].  She had long brown hair, large dark eyes, and barely said a word that first day.  I was proud to witness the kind, smart, hilarious girl who slowly emerged through Taylor Swift sing-a-longs and nights out at my favorite pizza restaurant where we soon ate regularly.  I was helping to build her self-confidence, but had not fully understood how she was changing me."
"Several months after we met, [Female]’s mom dropped her off for one of our routine visits and as she climbed out of the car my immediate reaction was one of surprise.  Where had her beautiful, long hair gone?  [Female] explained, “My four-year-old neighbor has cancer and has been going through chemo, so she lost all her hair.  She told me she didn’t feel pretty anymore, so to make her feel better I decided to shave my head.”  I was blown away by the selflessness of that gesture.  I still am not sure that I would have the confidence to do something as thoughtful as what [Female] did for her neighbor, but she made me want to try. "
"I have found that I often learn the most about who I am and who I want to become through dedicating my time to those around me. That is why I am a mentor, and that is why I am passionate about healthcare, an industry that impacts every person in the United States. "
"My work experience has convinced me that the healthcare industry must change in profound ways.  I began my career at [Healthcare Non-Profit], where my most meaningful assignment was an IT initiative at the [Healthcare Non-Profit] that transformed how the nation’s largest blood collection organization operates.  Inspired by that experience, I joined [Healthcare Corporation] to focus exclusively on healthcare and learn from a company with a passion for innovation."
"On a daily basis I witness the difficulty that providers face as they attempt to prioritize patients but are bogged down by outdated systems within their practice that cannot communicate with one another.  At [Healthcare Corporation] I have collaborated with other vendors to implement solutions that break down the walls between these systems, allowing providers to focus on patient needs rather than data entry.  My greatest strength is my ability to build relationships, through which I am able to unite stakeholders with a wide range of motivations.  This skill has played a critical role in my success at driving the complex projects I manage to completion. "
"Last January I learned that the fate of [Healthcare Corporation’s contracts with twelve practices and its relationship with [Health Care Provider Company], the largest healthcare provider in [Northeastern State], rested on the success of one project.  As [Health Care Provider] affiliates, the practices were obligated to transition from doing all of their work in [Healthcare Corporation] to completing certain tasks in the  [Health Care Provider] system.  The project objective was to build an interface to transfer patient data from computer software systems to [my Healthcare Corporation]’s online system, which would spare the practices from having to enter the same information in both systems.   More than a year into the project, the interface was now five weeks from the agreed upon go-live date, behind schedule, and at high risk of failure.  My assignment was to turn it around.  "
"Through experience I understood that ensuring an interface works from a technical standpoint often obscures the equally critical mission of training end users on how to leverage the interface to support their needs.  While assessing the project, I immediately observed that there was no plan to guide the twelve practices through the significant changes in their daily workflows that would soon occur.  This worried me far more than the myriad technical issues."
"I insisted that the interface not go live without end user training, and was surprised when [Health Care Provider] leadership maintained there was no time to complete training and no option to delay.  I feared the project would fail but was determined to do everything in my power to make it successful.  I called an emergency meeting between [Healthcare Corporation] and [Health Care Providers] leadership to draw attention to the existing issues and determine a path forward."
"I initially believed that the two organizations had fundamentally different priorities, but during that meeting I realized I had been wrong.  As we discussed the motivations behind each organization’s position, it became clear that both [Healthcare Corporation] and [Health Care Provider] sought to make the practices successful; the disagreement stemmed from differing opinions on how best to do so.  With common ground established, the tension between both sides quickly subsided.  We agreed to keep the go-live date, prioritized key technical fixes, and identified a training plan.  "
"The interface went live on schedule and without major issues.  A few weeks later, I received a call from a Practice Manager who had been particularly resistant to the change.  She informed me that her practice had mastered their new workflow and appreciated the support that both [Healthcare Corporation] and [Health Care Provider] had provided.  Of all the things that we accomplished during those last weeks, I am proudest of that moment."
